## CRITICAL SAFETY RAILS

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
- Limit prosecution data collection to 100 applications maximum
- Petition analysis limited to first 50 applications to prevent context explosion
- Requires both PFW and FPD MCPs - statistical analysis requires dual data sources
- Use date_range filters to focus analysis on relevant time periods
- Statistical significance requires minimum 20-30 applications for meaningful correlation
- Results are correlative, not causative - requires attorney judgment for interpretation

## PHASE 1: Analysis Scope Definition

Step 1: Determine analysis strategy:
```python
if examiner_name:
    analysis_scope = "individual_examiner"
    pfw_query = 'examinerNameText:"{examiner_name}"'
    comparison_baseline = "art_unit_average"

elif art_unit:
    analysis_scope = "art_unit_group"
    pfw_query = 'groupArtUnitNumber:{art_unit}'
    comparison_baseline = "technology_center_average"
```

Date Range Settings:
- 1_year: 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31
- 2_years: 2022-01-01 to 2024-12-31
- 3_years: 2021-01-01 to 2024-12-31
- 5_years: 2019-01-01 to 2024-12-31

Step 2: Validate analysis feasibility:
- Minimum sample size requirements (>20 applications for statistical significance)
- Data availability in both PFW and FPD systems
- Time range coverage and data completeness

## PHASE 2: Prosecution Data Collection (PFW MCP)

Step 3: Comprehensive prosecution pattern analysis using targeted fields:
```python
# CRITICAL: Use minimal search with fields parameter for efficient data retrieval
pfw_search_applications_minimal(
    query=pfw_query + ' AND filingDate:[start_date TO end_date]',
    fields=[
        'applicationNumberText',
        'applicationMetaData.examinerNameText',
        'applicationMetaData.groupArtUnitNumber', 
        'applicationMetaData.filingDate',
        'patentNumber'
    ],  # Only 5 fields vs 15 standard fields (70% reduction)
    limit=200  # Can search 200 vs ~40 with standard fields
)
```

**Benefits for Correlation Analysis:**
- Standard search: 200 results × 25KB = 5MB
- Targeted fields: 200 results × 2KB = 400KB (manageable)
- Enables more data points for statistical analysis

Prosecution Performance Metrics:

** Efficiency Indicators:**
- Grant rate: (Granted / Total Applications) × 100
- Average prosecution time: Filing to grant duration
- Office action efficiency: Average OAs per granted application
- Amendment frequency: Claim changes per application

** Quality Indicators:**
- Final rejection rate: Final OAs vs total OAs
- Continuation frequency: RCE and continuation filings
- Interview utilization: Examiner interview frequency
- Citation quality: Prior art relevance and comprehensiveness

** Consistency Indicators:**
- Decision pattern consistency
- Timeline predictability
- Application complexity handling
- Applicant response accommodation

## PHASE 3: Petition Frequency Analysis (FPD MCP)

Step 4: Cross-reference prosecution with petition data:
For each application from PFW data:
```
fpd_search_petitions_by_application(
    application_number=app_number,
    include_documents=False
)
```

Petition Pattern Classification:
- No petitions: Normal prosecution (baseline)
- Single petition: Minor procedural issue
- Multiple petitions: Systematic prosecution problems
- Red flag petitions: Denied petitions or examiner disputes

Correlation-Relevant Red Flags:
- DENIED_PETITION: Director denied the petition
- REVIVAL_PETITION: 37 CFR 1.137 (abandonment)
- EXAMINER_DISPUTE: 37 CFR 1.181 (supervisory review)

## PHASE 4: Statistical Correlation Analysis (if statistical_analysis=true)

Step 5: Calculate correlation coefficients:
- Prosecution-Petition Correlation: Pearson correlation between prosecution complexity and petition frequency
- Grant Rate-Petition Correlation: Correlation between examiner grant rates and petition rates
- Timeline-Petition Correlation: Correlation between prosecution length and petition occurrence
- Office Action-Petition Correlation: Correlation between OA count and petition frequency

Statistical Significance Testing:
- Sample size validation
- Confidence interval calculation
- P-value determination
- Correlation strength interpretation

Step 6: Benchmarking analysis:
- Individual examiner vs art unit average
- Art unit vs technology center average
- Performance differential calculation
- Percentile ranking assessment

## PHASE 5: Pattern Recognition & Insights

Correlation Pattern Analysis:

** NEGATIVE QUALITY CORRELATIONS:**
- High office action count -> High petition frequency
- Long prosecution timelines -> More revival petitions
- Frequent amendments -> More examiner disputes
- Low grant rates -> Higher procedural petition rates

**[OK] POSITIVE QUALITY CORRELATIONS:**
- Efficient prosecution -> Lower petition frequency
- High grant rates -> Minimal procedural issues
- Consistent decision patterns -> Fewer examiner disputes
- Proactive examiner communication -> Reduced conflicts

** NEUTRAL/COMPLEX CORRELATIONS:**
- Technology complexity may drive legitimate petition frequency
- Art unit policies may influence petition patterns
- Applicant experience may affect petition necessity

## PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

High Petition Risk Indicators:
- Grant rate <70% compared to art unit average
- Prosecution timeline >18 months above average
- Office action count >3 per application
- Amendment frequency >2 per application

Quality Improvement Recommendations:
- Enhanced examiner training on complex cases
- Improved applicant communication protocols
- Streamlined prosecution procedures
- Regular quality control reviews

Monitoring Suggestions:
- Monthly petition rate tracking
- Quarterly grant rate analysis
- Examiner performance reviews
- Applicant feedback collection
